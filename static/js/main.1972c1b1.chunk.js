With an overwhelming response, of nearly 20 participants from different BIT campuses  competed over weekly topics and provided the students their best knowledge. The topics  to be taught were wisely chosen by the Seniors , so that viewers  could learn and understand the basics, not only the topics were inter-related but also were very technical, so that  the enthusiasts had to explore new paths to learn , understand and teach  to the students. Vibrant entrants gave their best to teach the topics to the audience. The topics given to the participants  in these weeks were , The diode ,  Evolution of Data Storages , Evolution of Processors respectively. It was a very informative session which paved a way for students in learning the basics of ECE. After 3 weeks of teaching ,the final results have to heard out .

The workshop was concluded with certificate of participation given to the attendees to boost their confidence.",fblink:"https://www.facebook.com/ecesoc.bitmesra/posts/2433614343546932",instalink:""}],S=[],T=[];var E=function(e){var t=e.prop;return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"noEvent",children:[Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"No"}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:t}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"Event"})]})};function N(e,t){var n=e.src,i=e.name,a=e.rlink,s=e.details,o=e.fblink,r=e.instalink,c="images/events/"+n+".jpg";return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(p.jsx)("div",{className:"col-lg-5 col-md-10 events-pic",children:Object(p.jsx)(u,{src:c})}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-lg-7 col-md-10",children:[Object(p.jsx)("h1",{className:"event-name",children:i}),Object(p.jsx)("br",{}),s.map((function(e,t){return Object(p.jsx)("h5",{children:e},t)})),Object(p.jsx)("br",{}),Object(p.jsxs)("h3",{children:["For Registration :- ",Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:a,children:"Click here"}),Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:r,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-instagram event-icon"})}),Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:o,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-facebook-f event-icon"})})]})]}),Object(p.jsx)("hr",{})]},t)}var C=function(){var e=S.length,t=S.map(N);return e?t:Object(p.jsx)(E,{prop:"Ongoing"})};function I(e,t){var n=e.src,i=e.name,a=e.rlink,s=e.details,o=e.fblink,r=e.instalink,c="images/events/"+n+".jpeg";return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(p.jsx)("div",{className:"col-lg-5 col-md-10 events-pic",children:Object(p.jsx)(u,{src:c})}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-lg-7 col-md-10",children:[Object(p.jsx)("h1",{className:"event-name",children:i}),Object(p.jsx)("br",{}),s.map((function(e,t){return Object(p.jsx)("h5",{children:e},t)})),Object(p.jsx)("br",{}),Object(p.jsxs)("h4",{children:["For Registration :- ",Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:a,children:"Click here"}),Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:r,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-instagram event-icon"})}),Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:o,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-facebook-f event-icon"})})]})]}),Object(p.jsx)("hr",{})]},t)}var A=function(){var e=T.length,t=T.map(I);return e?t:Object(p.jsx)(E,{prop:"Upcoming"})};function P(e,t){var n=e.name,i=e.Participants,a=e.src,s=e.Description,o=e.fblink,r=e.instalink,c="images/events/"+a+".jpg";return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"row",children:[Object(p.jsx)("div",{className:"col-lg-5 col-md-12 events-pic",children:Object(p.jsx)(u,{src:c})}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-lg-7 col-md-12",children:[Object(p.jsx)("h1",{className:"event-name",children:n}),Object(p.jsxs)("h4",{children:["Participants: ",i]}),Object(p.jsx)("h4",{children:"Description :"}),Object(p.jsx)("h6",{children:Object(p.jsx)("em",{children:s})}),""!==r&&Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:r,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-instagram pevent-icon"})}),Object(p.jsx)("a",{href:o,children:Object(p.jsx)("i",{className:"fab fa-facebook-f pevent-icon"})})]}),Object(p.jsx)("hr",{})]},t)}var M=function(){return x.map(P)};n(36);var D=function(){var e=Object(i.useState)("U"),t=Object(r.a)(e,2),n=t[0],a=t[1];return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"event-List",children:[Object(p.jsx)("span",{onClick:function(){return a("U")},className:"U"===n?"changeEvent":null,children:"UPCOMING EVENTS"}),Object(p.jsx)("span",{onClick:function(){return a("O")},className:"O"===n?"changeEvent":null,children:"ONGOING EVENTS"}),Object(p.jsx)("span",{onClick:function(){return a("P")},className:"P"===n?"changeEvent":null,children:"PAST EVENTS"}),"U"===n&&Object(p.jsx)(A,{}),"O"===n&&Object(p.jsx)(C,{}),"P"===n&&Object(p.jsx)(M,{})]})};var B=function(){return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(p.jsx)("strong",{children:"What We do"}),Object(p.jsx)("br",{}),Object(p.jsxs)("ul",{children:[Object(p.jsx)("li",{children:"We conduct various workshops on both core and non-core topics, including analog electronics, computer vision etc."}),Object(p.jsx)("li",{children:"We organize various online quizzes with prizes for the best performers."}),Object(p.jsx)("li",{children:"We release online content on various subjects based on trending topics which are informative and useful."}),Object(p.jsx)("li",{children:"We also conduct counselling sessions where we discuss about various career options after college."})]})]})};n(37);var R=function(){return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"what-we-do",children:["ECE Society BIT Mesra aims to provide a platform where electronics enthusiasts can come together and learn this vast and interesting subject.
